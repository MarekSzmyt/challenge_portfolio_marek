## Subtask 3
üëã Hey! My name is Marek. I started this project to learn basics of manual testing, and hopufully get the deeper understanding of the development process. I'm already learned a little bit of frontend and I work daily as an UX designer.

Also, testings sounds like a lot of fun and combines it with my goal of making products better for the Users.

#### Possible improvements/changes

- no e-mail validation for remind password 
- option to delete content (player, match, report)
- adding some element (i.e bar) to the selected state on the dashboard, with only color change it may not be accessible

### User Interface
- Very text heavy makes it hard to comprehend.
- Raw and cold does not make it fun to use.
- A lot of layout missalignements and visual incosistencies makes me feel it's an amateur website.

### User Experience

#### login:
- I would ignore white spaces in the e-mail in the beggining and at the end when validating the login.
#### general:
- adding a plaer should be available at the players listing
- incosistent CTA
#### adding a player:
- asterix is not explained anywhere
