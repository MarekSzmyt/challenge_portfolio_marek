👋 Hey! My name is Marek. I started this project to learn basics of manual testing, and hopufully get the deeper understanding of the development process. I'm already learned a little bit of frontend and I work daily as an UX designer.

Also, testings sounds like a lot of fun and combines it with my goal of making products better for the Users.
